# What is parsing? 
It the conversion of one data format to another, easily readable data format. For example, if you receive data in HTML format, with the help of a parser, you’ll be able to translate the data into a more understandable form. 
Usually, data parsing goes hand-in-hand with data extraction or, as we know it, web scraping. First, the data is scraped from the targeted websites and then transformed into a format that is easier to read and work with. 



# What exactly does a parser do?
It delivers a portion of commands and instructions and divides them  into other pieces in programming. After this, it checks if this data is enough to create a data structure known as a parse tree. 
Example--
A well-built HTML parser identifies the required HTML data in the parsing process, extracts the needed information and converts it into JSON, CSV or a table depending on the pre-written code.A parser itself doesn’t carry a specific data format. Instead, the conversion process depends on how the parser was built.
 


# Application of Data parsing --
Used in various business fields, such as SEO analysis, operation optimization, investment, and competitive analysis.
